## Introduction

The Big Cartoon Quiz is an online multi-option quiz game. The user initially lands on the homepage, where they are asked to insert their name and then have the option to click 'Start' the quiz button. After clicking the 'start' the quiz button, a little message appears in the  box explaining the rules of the game and the user has the choice of either continuing to the quiz or clicking the exit button. The quiz consists of ten questions on various cartoon movies. The questions are multiple choice-based questions, and the user has a 15 second time limit to answer each question. A progress bar, question count and the time remaining per question is shown on-screen to the user, so they are aware of what question they are on and how long the time they have remaining to answer the current question. Once an answer has been selected, the timer stops counting down, and if the answer is correct, the option will turn green, if the answer is incorrect the user option will turn red, and the correct answer will be displayed by turning green. At the end of each question, the user will need to click on next to move onto the next question. At the end of the 10 questions, the user is brought to an end-of-quiz screen to see their score and get feedback, from this point they can choose to replay the game or try again. Depending on each user’s score, different feedback will be displayed on the screen. 

The current questions on the quiz are well suited for players of any age and die-hard cartoon fans will more than likely be able to get a good score. A potential future feature could be adding topics to the quiz an letting users pick the exact movie, character or genre they want to answer questions on and having separate quizzes for each topic. I could also add various difficulty levels for users who really want to challenge themselves i.e., easy, medium, and hard. I would also like to implement live user boards for players who have taken the quiz, to make the challenge a little more interactive for competitive users, and then highest and fastest score to date, for teh competitive users to try and beat.

## Features

There are two pages on website, a Home page and a Contact Us page. Both pages feature the ‘The Big Cartoon Quiz’ logo on the top left-hand side of the page, as well as a red banner and a nav bar. The logo, menu bar and red banner are also displayed on the bottom of each page.

The images are all relevant to the contents of the quiz and really help the user understand the purpose of the website.

**Future Features Implementation**





## Design

•	Imagery - The images that I chose were to complement the red/yellow/white colour scheme and also to reference some of the movie characters that are mentioned in the quiz questions. The overall effect is designed to look modern, fun, colourful, playful to adults and a younger audience. All UX features including the layout of the images, the game and the questions have been based on my own design work. 

•	Colour Scheme -The colour scheme across the screens was kept simple and consistent, I chose a red, yellow and white palette, as I thought that’s what best suited the cartoon theme that I was going for. 


•	Typography - Google Fonts were used to import the Bungee font into styles.css. I chose Bungee was the font as it was bold, big and had a cartoon like look, which I felt was relevant to the content of the website.

•	Wireframes - Desktop Wireframes, Tablet Wireframes, Smartphone Wireframes

## Testing
